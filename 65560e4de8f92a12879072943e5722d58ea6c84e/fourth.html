        You have no idea how many times I annoyed gayathri and Ashwin asking them, "If you are gonna be my friend again?" "If we will be back hanging out normally" 
        They are so frustrated with me now, before they used to reply positively, now they are like: "It won't be normal, go and try to deal with it"
        <br>
        <img src="house_nod_2.gif" alt = "">

         I was not sad or anything after your response that day... You can easily see that on my face if I was sad...
         You felt guilty about your response.
         You'll never believe it. Even after your reply to the text, I was actually happy that day you called me "best friend", and I told ashwin thrice which weirded him out.
        
       
        <br>
        <br>
        I just want you to know, what happened after friday, I still don't know If I did something to piss you off.. 
        And don't tell me it's just you feeling guilty.. If you ask me there is nothing and absolutely nothing to feel guilty about.
        You are a good friend to me!!
        
        <br>
        <br>
        I cannot even tell if things are normal, or if they are not.... 
        I just know that you are not behaving the same way you used to and your texts are not normal, you are almost close to avoiding me... you probably are still feeling awkward,
        But It feels like you decided to slowly avoid me.. (I am not even sure about any of this being true tho).. These are just the thoughts running in my mind.
        <br>
        I can understand if you don't want to talk to me or hangout with me for some days, but It feels like It's never going back to normal.. 
        and I don't know what to do.
        It's actually very embarassing for me to fight for friendship I have never done this before, I hope you know how special friend you are to me..
        It's so much fun to hang out and study in the neurobio lab... I was very happy dude...
        <br>
        I wish I should have told all of this sooner, but I didn't get the chance and for my worst luck, I got very sick for the first time in berhampur.
        And obviously I don't want to text you this during end-sem exams!!
        <br>
        Remember you mentioned to me that there is courage in shutting up and not telling about liking a person.. 
        Now I feel I should have had that courage to shut up, but it feels like being dishonest in friendship..
        <br>
        I don't know how to convey this, I am not cool enough to convey this in-person. 
        Before you think this is weird, just remember I am a total nerd, I don't know how to convey this stuff in cool fashion. This is just the way I know...
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, you're my best friend, and I told you I like you, that's it. I hope its not so much weird to get 
        past through this. Most people who tell this want to have a relationship and stuff, but I am built differently than Others,
        Remember i didn't feel anything after iGEM results, its always different how I react to situations. It's never normal with me.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        Probably, this effort will come across as begging for friendship, which is very weird for a 20 year old.
        But I don't care!! I just wanted to share this that's it.. otherwise my pulse will still stay at 100..( I am so afraid it's not coming down!!)
        If you were a therapist(you said you are a free therapist to me once, lol) and if you have to listen through all of this, It would cost me 1000 Dollars I guess.. lol
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for everything!! :)) and I am sorry if I hurt you :(
        <br>
        Please be my best friend again!!!
          <br>
          It always happens with me and my close friends. I constantly keep losing them.. Sneha was a close friend before, but she left too.. with her own share of issues.

        <br>
        Probably things are already normal, but it's just me thinking all this.. 
        And me doing this website shit is making it all awkward, If that is the case, just close it immediately....
        <br>
        See I told you being my therapist is hard, you probably want to get paid very well if you are ever my therapist lol..
        And you volunteered yourself...
        <br>
      
        I never got the change to talk to you in berhampur. 
        If you want to call and talk after reading through this, that will be great!!
        <br>
        <br>
        And last thing, I will never ever mention the stuff from this site ever again.. 
        <br>
        In fact the program I wrote will delete the site 24 hours after you login with the password!!
        so, this will never be awkward!!
        But it's cool with me if you want to joke about it sometime later, that I embarassed myself by doing this..LOL
