        You have no idea how many times I annoyed gayathri and Ashwin asking them, "If you are gonna be my friend again?" "If we will be back hanging out normally?", "If you'll come to the lab again?"
        They are so frustrated with me now, before they used to reply positively, now they are like: "It won't be normal, go and try to deal with it"
        <br>
        I thought after I return from home, things will be back to normal. But they are not!! 
        <br>

         I was not sad after your response that day... You can easily see that on my face if I was sad...
         Even after your reply to my text, I was actually happy that day you called me "best friend", and I told ashwin thrice which weirded him out.
        
   
        <br>
        <br>
        I just want to know, what happened after friday, I still don't know If I did something to piss you off.. 
        <br>
        Because everything was going so good on friday!! and then things are different the next day. 
        
        <br>
        And I don't know if it's just you feeling guilty.. If you ask me there is nothing and absolutely nothing to feel guilty about.
        You are a good friend to me!! You told me I am the coolest person (surpassed my brother) and you said you like me!!
        
        
        <br>
        <br>
        I cannot even tell if things are normal, or if they are not.... 
        I just know that you are not behaving the same way you used to, you are almost close to avoiding me... you probably are still feeling awkward,
        But It feels like you decided to slowly avoid me.. (I am not even sure about any of this being true tho).. It's just torture not knowing what is happening!!
        
        <br>
        <br>
        I can understand if you don't want to talk to me or hangout with me for some days, but It feels like It's never going back to normal.. 
        and I don't know what to do.
        It's actually very hard for me to fight for friendship I have never done this before, I hope you know how special friend you are to me..
        
        <br>
        <br>
        I AM FILING A PETITION: "I WANT MY BEST FRIEND BACK!!!"
        <br>
        <br>
        I wish I could have told all of this sooner, but I didn't get the chance and for my worst luck, I got very sick for the first time in berhampur.
        And obviously I don't want to text you this during end-sem exams!!
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Before you think this is weird, just remember I am a total nerd, I don't know how to convey this stuff in cool fashion. This is just the way I know...
        <br>
        <br>
        DUDEE, YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND IN THE INSTITUTE!!, and I did a dumb thing and made it all awkward, that's it. I hope its not so much weird to get 
        past through this. By looking at the way things are, I am so afraid soon I will become a stranger to you... It's freaking me out!!
        <br>
        <br>
       
        Probably, this effort will come across as begging for friendship, which is very weird for a 20 year old.
        But I don't care!! I just wanted to share this that's it..
        Thank god you are a free therapist or else for all this whining you would have priced this session for 1000 dollars!! 
       
        <br>
        
        I probably just need assurance from you, because I am so confused..<br>
        Something like... 
        "Sandesh, You're still my best friend, nothing changed or it will be back to normal soon, it's just you whining dumbass!!"
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        I wrote a lot of stuff, because I am not sure if I get a chance to talk about this again. This is the last time I am gonna weird you out, I PROMISE!!
        
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you dude for everything!! :)) and I am sorry if I hurt you :(
        <br>
        Best friends forgive each other's dumb stuff right!! Just for this once ...
      
        <br>
        Please be my best friend again!!!
        
        <br>
        <br>
        Probably things are already normal, but it's just me thinking all this.. 
        <br>
        If you're feeling awkward about talking with me, just text me once in a while. That'll assure me that you're not avoiding <br>
        
        <br>
        See I told you being my therapist is hard, you probably want to get paid very well if you are my therapist lol..
        And you volunteered yourself...
        <br>
      
        I never got the chance to talk to you in berhampur. 
        If you want to call and talk after this, that will be great!!
        <br>
        <br>
        And one last thing, I will never ever mention the stuff from this site ever again.. 
        <br>
        In fact the program I wrote will delete the site 24 hours after you login with the password!!
        so, this will never be awkward!!
        But it's cool with me if you want to joke about it sometime later, that I embarassed myself by doing this..LOL
