        <br>
        Remember once you said you are a free therapist to me, keeping that in mind, I am writing all this stuff.. 
        Since I cannot contact my free therapist in-person I had to do this..
        <br>
        <br>
        Something about my medical leave I did not tell anyone. One of the other reasons I took a medical leave
        is because of my mom's health. The last time I visited home, she is getting treated for high Blood pressure and 
        High pulse rate, it's probably because both of us staying very far from home and she's worried about our health.
        I came back to berhampur, but I couldn't focus and I couldn't even share this with anyone else, things are not the same like 
        before so I couldn't focus on exams. So I immediately took a medical leave and left for home. Don't tell this to gayathri or ashwin,
        they'll freak out again....
        <br>
        <br>
        coming back to funny stuff happened in Novemeber...
        <br>
        <br>
          
        I made a very funny comment on bhavana ma’am (about her academic expertise..) when i did not realise vivek is sitting in the next cubicle(he’s sneaks into the lab very silently).. He laughed.. But I am not sure if he’s fine with that.. I am scared!!!
        <br>

        <br>

        I LIED TO RAHUL SHARMA.. 
        <br>
        <br>
        He sent me mail mentioning some attachments and I did not look at it.. And I sent a generic reply (“thank you sir, I recieved the data”) when he forgot  to attach the data in the mail..( The most embarassing I can get I guess)
        Rahul sharma is a lol nerd.. I lied to him also about reading first three percy jackson books.. He won’t stop mentioning about harry potter and percy jackson..(he’s a fan btw!). He used harry potter references in the mail too, lmaoo.. But he is like me, he like harry potter more than percy jackson..hehehehehe.. He is a Gryffindor too!!!! I am so happy with this PI.
        I should stop lying to him. He asked me if I need any help health-wise and recommended few hospitals in berhampur. I can probably crash at his place too sometime in the next semester.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        BRO, ASHWIN IS LEAVING for REAL!! 
        <br>
        <br>I always thought he will stay in the last moment he will make that decision.. But nope he is leaving berhampur forever.. And again my stupid health, I took the medical leave went to lab to pack, I never realised that is the last time I get to see him, I did not even give him a huggg daaa.. I said bye and left.. I have no clue why i did that. I called him next day for coming to the station.. But that dude got drunk with his friends and slept off and woke up in the evening ( I would like to think he got drunk because I am leaving and he won’t get to meet me, but we’ll never know he is cryptic!!!)
        <br>
        <br>
        I AM HAVING ANXIETY ISSUES!!
        <br>
        I am having too much anxiety these days, that I am continously pooping and throwing up when I get anxious.. 
        I am also having high pulse rate because of all the spicy food I eat here ig..<br>
        It's because of all the uncertainity that is happening around me, Every single thing changed, you changed how you 
        used to be around me.. It's too much to take in .<br>
        For the first time in 7 years I cried my hearts out one day in hostel, I didn't know whom to call, I called gayathri and asked her to 
        just stay on the call and not to talk anything... I never thought I am capable of crying till that point.
        You also know I am too broke to see a therapist..
        <br>
        <hr>
        Btw i did the site because this long text on whatsapp is very weird!! And also I think this is cool....
        <br>
        <br>
        Dude.. I don’t even have any clue if this thing is gonna make you:
        <li>Angry</li>
        <li>Awkward and very weird</li>
        <li>Prolly think this is very cool!!( low hopes)</li>
        <br>
        But realize that I used to talk a lot with you, and i couldn’t talk to you for a month…
        And I never vent out about stuff to anyone so this will be the first time lol..
        I think by this time, I told all the people surrounding me, many times that <br>
        You are my best friend!!  And I can share anything with you and I did, but I never thought that one thing I tell you will make stuff upside down!!
        <br>
       I could have told you this after we come back to next semester but I have anxiety!! And again because of my stupid health and end-sem preparation I couldn’t travel to chennai also (I told you marina beach is not written in my fate!! I will never grow up and vist that place and I have no hopes on sambar rice or adyar anand bhavan too!!)
        
        <br>
        <br>
        Haa now to some cool stuff.. I thought of giving ashwin a going away present. I brought a book and put that in 
        the drawer in my cubicle. Gayathri won't give it, because it's gonna look weird. You said If I want to do anything special to ashwin
        before going away you're gonna come, If you want give that book to him. He thinks you are his friend btw!! He told me this!!
