        I made a very funny comment on bhavana ma’am (about her academic expertise..) when i did not realise vivek is sitting in the next cubicle(he’s sneaks into the lab very silently).. He laughed.. But I am not sure if he’s fine with that.. I am scared!!!

        I LIED TO RAHUL SHARMA.. 
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Rahul sharma is a lol nerd.. I lied to him about reading first three percy jackson books.. He won’t stop mentioning about harry potter and percy jackson..(he’s a fan btw!). He used harry potter references in the mail too, lmaoo.. But he is like me, he like harry potter more than percy jackson..hehehehehe.. He is a Gryffindor too!!!!
        We had a meeting after I reached bpr, I mentioned Dementors when we are talking about percy jackson LOL he didn't even correct(You would have prolly killed me on the spot!!). I am so happy with this PI.
        I should stop lying to him. He asked me if I need any help health-wise and recommended few hospitals in berhampur. I can probably crash at his place too sometime in the next semester.

        BRO, ASHWIN IS LEAVING for REAL!! 
        <br>
        <br>I always thought he will stay. But nope he is leaving berhampur forever.. And again my stupid health, I took the medical leave went to lab to pack, I never realised that is the last time I get to see him, I did not even give him a huggg daaa.. I said bye and left.. I have no clue why i did that. I called him next day for coming to the station.. But that dude got drunk with his friends and slept off and woke up in the evening ( I would like to think he got drunk because I am leaving and he won’t get to meet me, but we’ll never know he is cryptic!!!)

        I AM HAVING ANXIETY ISSUES!!
        <br>
        I am having too much anxiety, that I am continously pooping and throwing up when I get anxious(I know, it's YUCK!!).. Damn it, my pulse rate is not going anything below 120!! 
        Because it's looking like things won't be back to normal, and I am so scared that you decided to avoid me and will never be back to normal.<br>
        For the first time in 5 years I cried a lot one day in hostel, I didn't know whom to call, I called gayathri and asked her to 
        just stay on the call and not to talk anything and she cried with me(for no reason!!)...<br>
        I am not very strong enough when it comes to missing close friends!, I am very fragile .. and I am too broke to see a therapist..<br>
        Turns out, that stupid "ALL IS WELL" mantra doesn't work all the time!!
        <br>

        DUDEE, I HAVE A REAL SHOT AT VISTING MIT!!
        <br>
        Julia Con is going to be held at MIT in-person during July. Srijith and I are writing a proposal for the conferece talk.
        If it gets selected I might actually go and visit MIT!!! Don't worry, I am gonna bring you merch, not like our iGEM Parisians!!
        <br>
        <hr>
        Btw i put this on a site because very long texts on whatsapp are very weird, don't you think?!! And also I think way it looks cool....
        <br>
        
        <br>
        I used to share a lot of stuff with you bruhh, and I couldn’t talk to you for a month… and you never gave me the chance while in berhampur(Even Jason Bourne won't forgive you for this!!) <br>
        And I never vent out about stuff to anyone so this will be the first time lol.. 
        <br>
