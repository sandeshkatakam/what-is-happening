        <br>
        <br>
          
        A couple of things I never got the chance to tell you.. Because I was not in berhampur physically and we never talked during my time in berhampur.
        <br>
        <br>
      
        
        <br>I was always a friend to you from the beginning I never had any hidden intentions for doing the stuff I did.. I think you know me well enough to trust me on this!! I did that birthday website because you mentioned that your friends forget your birthday all the time and I have a habit of forgetting b’day’s (you know this better!! lol) and its a cool project. 
        <br>I made Mythomagic cards because you said you always wanted to have them and you called my brother a cool guy for having them (which he just brought from a store) and I hate when someone calls him cool.. It’s something between us brothers, you’ll not understand..lmao
        <br>And that last few days of iGEM is very bitter for all of us.. And I don’t want to end iGEM (something only both of us worked hard for, yeah i can tell that now!! lol) to end that way…. So I printed it right away!! Otherwise it was planned for when you get the highest SPI award ( which I thought you will after looking at your midsem marks !!! perfect scores damnit!!)
        That's why I was asking for your mid-sem scores after examsss.. 
        

        <br>
        <br>
        
        I seriously don’t know how to prove it to you, but I am not. I was just a friend to you all that time.. 
        It’s not a math theorem so that I can prove it.  There were lot of people who asked me about what is happening.. I always responded that we are friends probably best friends and nothing more.. I don’t know if there is a way to prove this.. But if you trust me on this…PLEASE… Even ashwin asked me many times about this I always told him, we are best friends!!

        <br>
        <br>
       

        I know you might think I should have avoided telling this stuff too.. But comeon, It’ll never be normal if I don’t ever clear it up

        <br>
        <br>
        I even told ashwin on that day that I don’t want to bother you about any relationship stuff, because I am not interested in having relationships in college.. Which is apparent everytime we talk about other couples in the college and I practically call them dumb for whatever drama they are doing in the institute. Come on, after all the conversation we had that day in the ITI ground about me sharing about my responsibilities and family stuff and you telling about yours, how did you think I am gonna bother you or myself with relationship stuff..and you started going on and on about relationships when I just told you that I like you. I couldn't stop the conversation.. Even in the text I mentioned, “Do you like me? (“no follow-up questions will be there”)”.
        Because I just wanted to know that, that's it, nothing more!!! 

        <br>
        <br>
        I felt like I am your best friend when you shared your stuff with me, I felt like we are very close friends that you are comfortable with sharing all that stuff with me.
        I don't know what physical gesture to do, I am very awkward. I still remember I patted on your head while leaving the bus.. which is very LLOLL!!
        <br>
        <br>
        Even that day I don’t want to confess. Because I never was asking for a relationship. That day I asked you if you ever will be in relationship because I was curious why you don’t want to…
        And you kept mentioning swapnali's experience with relationships and you being insecure, so I wanted to convince that you shouldn't be insecure and you're capable enough that's it.. 
        That’s why i asked and I never like asked you out or anything like that if you recall…

        <br>
        <br>
        And what about you telling that ‘“I probably deserve it and I would understand if you don’t want me around and don’t want me to sit in the lab”” . I was super angry that day, when you told me this…and i stopped myself from telling this stuff that day because you already seemed very sad, i don’t want to continue. 
        I was hurt that day because you thought that I hanged out with you all this time because of that.. and I would stop talking to you just because you responded that way.. YOU KNOW ME BETTER!!
        <br>
        And you thought it's scary that I know a lot of stuff about you, It's not!! I promise I would not steal your identity. 
        I think I know too much about you becuase we are friends and we hang out.. that's it!!
        <br>
        <br>
        AND I SWEAR YOU NEVER LED ME ON TO ANYTHING..
        <br>
        Probably you thinking this, changed you after that day with me. You were always like a good friend to me and I took a lot of advice from you (a lot in choosing projects!!), we never even went any further discussing about this shittt..
        I just wanted to be honest with you about something that's been bothering me for few days.. That's the only thing that led me on for telling you...
        <br>
        <br>
        I even told you that stuff that day, because you shared with me a lot and you continously keep accusing me of hiding things behind that smile.. And that is the only stuff I hid from you, the thought which came into my mind!!!! So, I always tried to be honest with you..

        <br>
        <br>
        It's too hard for me!! I stopped myself from saying this.. Whenever I wanted to share stuff (like funny stuff happening with rahul sharma and vivek ..my sweet PIs and stuff about the contrast enhancement guyyy) , I generally do that only to you, and now you never talk like before…
        You never come in to the lab to talk with me also.. 
        <br>
